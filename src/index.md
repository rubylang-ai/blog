# Fine-Tuning an LLM for Ruby

## Introduction

I'm thrilled to announce the inception of **RubyLang.ai** â€“ a project dedicated
to fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for Ruby. This journey
will be open-source and built in public, inviting the entire Ruby community to
contribute and benefit from the advancements.

## Project Goals

1. **Fine-Tuning an LLM for Ruby:** This model will be tailored to reflect the
   Ruby community's preferences for high quality, elegant design, and preferred
   syntax.
2. **Open Source and Community-Driven:** Training will leverage the wealth of
  open-source Ruby projects, comprehensive documentation, how-to guides, and
  other valuable community-contributed content. All content used for training
  will obtain proper consent from the contents' owner(s), and fully documented.
3. **Building in Public:** Transparency is key. Every step of the
  development process will be shared, encouraging collaboration and
  feedback from the Ruby community.

## Project Name

After much contemplation, I have chosen to name this endeavor
**RubyLang.ai**. This name embodies the core of our mission: to enhance
and celebrate the Ruby programming language through artificial
intelligence.

## Logo

The initial logo, crafted with the help of Midjourney and inspired by
the creativity of _Why, symbolizes the fusion of traditional Ruby
elegance with modern AI innovation.

Stay tuned for more updates as we embark on this exciting adventure
together. Your support and contributions will be invaluable in shaping
the future of RubyLang.ai!
